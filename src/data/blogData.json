In reality, their biggest problem is <strong>fulfillment structure</strong>. If you generate 50 new clients tomorrow but your fulfillment team is chaotic, you will lose those clients within 60 days and burn your reputation in the process.</p><h3>Step 1: Simplify Your Offer</h3><p>Stop selling 15 different services. Pick the one that has the highest margin and the easiest fulfillment cycle. Productize it.</p><h3>Step 2: Automate Onboarding</h3><p>Your client onboarding should not require 4 manual emails and a 90-minute kickoff call that goes off-topic. Use a structured intake form and an automated welcome sequence.</p><p><em>Once you have structure, then you can scale sales. Not before.</em></p>"
